                <p class="ps-5">Over the last several years, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of web technologies and talented people. I consider myself a front-ender first, but am comfortable utilizing my skills on both ends of the tech stack. I strive to stay up-to-date on the latest programming principles and continually look for ways to improve my development abilities.</p>
                <p class="ps-5">When I'm not mashing away at a keyboard you can find me binging a TV series, catching the games of my favorite sports teams, looking for good drinks/food, tackling the next home improvement project, or planning my next trip.</p>
                <p class="mb-0 ps-5">Check out the <a routerLink="/games">games library</a> I'm building! It's a constant work in progress, but I continue to add and improve on my favorite games as I find time.</p>
